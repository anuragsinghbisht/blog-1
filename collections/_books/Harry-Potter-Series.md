Quite a number of kids grow up to become potter heads - For it not only conjures images of a far away land where magic is real and dragons are alive, it has a certain charm about it and a beautiful way of teaching some of life's best lessons through its characters.

I grew up with it as a kid and no matter how much I read, I still find a thing or two giving me "Aha!" moments every single time. It is very surreal, I know :)

Some of its best quotes here -

### 1. Socerer's Stone

1. “The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.”
2. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.” - Dumbledore
3. “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”
4. “Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”

### 2. Chamber of Secrets

1. “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

### 3. Prisoner of Azkaban

1. “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”
2. “You think the dead we loved truly ever leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly in times of great trouble?”
3. “What you fear most of all is —fear. Very wise...”
4. “He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though...keep up with my news...check if I'm happy...”
5. “Mischief Managed.”
6. “The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed.”

### 4. Goblet of Fire

1. "If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals"
2. "It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be"
3. "Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory."
4. "We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided."


### 5. Order Of Phoenix

1. “Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.”
2. “Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.”
3. Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect
4. Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.
5. “You should write a book," Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, "translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them.
