Quite a number of kids grow up to become potter heads - For it not only conjures images of a far away land where magic is real and dragons are alive, it has a certain charm about it and a beautiful way of teaching some of life's best lessons through its characters.

I grew up with it as a kid and no matter how much I read, I still find a thing or two giving me "Aha!" moments every single time. It is very surreal, I know :)

Some of its best quotes here -

### 1. Socerer's Stone

1. “The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.”
2. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.” - Dumbledore
3. “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”
4. “Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”

### 2. Chamber of Secrets

1. “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

### 3. Prisoner of Azkaban

1. “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”
2. “You think the dead we loved truly ever leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly in times of great trouble?”
3. “What you fear most of all is —fear. Very wise...”
4. “He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though...keep up with my news...check if I'm happy...”
5. “Mischief Managed.”
6. “The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed.”
