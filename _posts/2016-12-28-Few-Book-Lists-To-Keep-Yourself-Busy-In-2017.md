tags: open, weekends

Despite some bad experiences, 2016 has been a beautiful year - for having realized that books can be a great way to have fun, learn stuff, gain exposure and grow! Over the past 12 months, I might have bookmarked close to a 100 books, but never actually got the time to finish many. Most of them picked from the lists I found on social media. Here are few of those lists that piqued my interest - in a variety of subjects. I hope to complete a few this year and I guess you'll be equally interested in doing that too!

### Update - March 17, 2018

Over two years, I was able to take up very little in book reading but did manage to collect more books. Not sure if I feel happy or sad at this moment. Nonetheless, I managed to collect more book lists. Some of them super-awesome in terms of content.

1. [Lobsters' thread on 2017's best books](https://lobste.rs/s/i9s39q/best_books_you_have_read_2017). If you find it tedious to go over, a compilation of the same in my blog [here](/2018/01/01/Best-Books-Of-2017/).
2. [100 best Nonfiction books of all time](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/31/the-100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time-the-full-list)
3. [30 Self-Help Books That Permanently Changed My Life](https://www.xojane.com/newagey/30-self-help-books-that-permanently-changed-my-life)
4. [Derek Siver's book list](https://sivers.org/book) - Really recommend going over this list if you haven't already. Accompanied by book notes, books in his list will really give get your mind thinking and contemplating on a wide variety of issues.
