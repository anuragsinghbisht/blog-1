Virtualization is always a very fancy jargon to use. It is more like "Big Data" in that, not many know what it really means, how and where to actually use it but nevertheless try their best to keep a frightfully serious face and throw shit at us for hours. If you have had the exact same feeling about Virtualization and felt sorry for not trying to go beyond installing Virtualbox, then I encourage you to go ahead, read this post to gain knowledge and make some karma.
