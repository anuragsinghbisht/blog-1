Virtualization is a very fancy jargon to use. It is more like "Big Data" in that, not many know what it really means, how and where to actually use it, but nevertheless try their best to keep a frightfully serious face and throw shit at us for hours. My definition of virtualization didn't go beyond "installing Virtualbox" for more than a good 6-7 years until a couple of weeks back. And things did seem pretty simple the way I saw it - "Running an operating system inside another operating system". It is that simple, yes, except its not with what's under the hood.

Oh! So, is that all the fuss is about? OS inside another OS? No. That is so 2000s. There's so much more to VMs than just trying to play with Ubuntu inside a Windows machine. VMs are a way by which...Hang on. On a second thought, I think it'd only make sense for us to start from the get go - from where it started.

##What do you know about virtualization?

Well, what is so complicated? You put in another OS
