Few things have always interested me for no reason - viz., setting up a server - what I really mean is spinning up a new server/VM instance with a new operating system that I haven't tried yet, trying out a new window manager, stacking a shelf full of books.

As part of that exercise this Saturday has been trying out the ```i3``` window manager. Part of the reason is my nerd curiosity which has been tempting me to try it for a while. But part of it is also the efficiency at which you can get things done. It is super efficient if you want a desktop environment that is less resource intensive. The one I currently use is the ```mate-desktop``` - which is already super productive. But ```i3``` looks promising.

For more information, follow the [Youtube Screencasts on ```i3wm``` by CodeCast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf).

Below are some shortcuts that can be used wih ```i3wm``` - more like notes from the Screencast.

1. Starting a new terminal - ```Mod + E```.
2. Moving across the Windows - ```Mod + Arrow Keys```.
3. Set window tiling to Stacked - ```Mod + S```
4. Set window tiling to Tab mode - ```Mod + W```
5. Close the window - ```Mod + Shift + Q```
6. Resize window - ```Mod + R```. Use the right and left arrow keys to resize now.
7. Move windows around - ```Mod + Shift + Arrow Keys```
8. Move around workspaces - ```Mod + <workspace_Number>```
9. Move windows between workspaces - ```Mod + Shift + <workspace_Number>```
10. Run dialog - ```Mod + D```
11. Quit ```i3``` / Logout - ```Mod + Shift + E```
