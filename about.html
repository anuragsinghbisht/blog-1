    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Well, truth be told I'm that modest geek that every gang has, shying away credits when he fixes PCs for the oldies next door, <b>desperately</b> hoping to shed that typical image of him to see some inroads into actual technology :D So, on this quest to become my own version of Mozzie, more often than not, you'll find notes on technology, occasionally some rant and some great gossip. <br/>Happy reading!</p>
