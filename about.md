	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_White_Collar_characters#Mozzie" target="_blank">Mozzie</a> of Madras. Square eyes. Shorcut show-off. Sluggard. Lousy singer. <a href="http://thehangover.wikia.com/wiki/Alan_Garner" target="_blank">Alan</a> of my wolfpack.

Well, truth be told I'm that modest geek that every gang has, shying away credits when he fixes PCs for the oldies next door, **desperately** hoping to shed that typical image of him to see some inroads into actual technology :D

So, on this quest to become my own version of Mozzie, more often than not, you'll find notes on technology, occasionally some rant and some great gossip.

Happy reading!
