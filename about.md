	23. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_White_Collar_characters#Mozzie" target="_blank">Mozzie</a> of Madras. Square eyes. Shorcut show-off. Sluggard. Lousy singer. <a href="http://thehangover.wikia.com/wiki/Alan_Garner" target="_blank">Alan</a> of my wolfpack.
</p>

Well, truth be told I'm that modest geeky guy that every gang has, shying away credits that the aunties and uncles next door shower when he formats their PC with the latest Windows, **desperately** hoping to shed that typical image of him to see some inroads into actual technology. :D

So, on this quest to become my own version of Mozzie, more often than not, you'll find notes on technology, occasionally some rant and some great gossip. 

Happy reading!
